# Introduction - Ethics and Safety

## The role of the ethics and safety team is to prioritize the well-being and safety of Palestinians and Pals, while also ensuring that our actions are in alignment with the core values and principles of PalCollective.    

### We are committed to:   
**Continuous Improvement:** As our collective grows, we continuously refine and update our processes and approaches to better safeguard the interests of the app and its users.  

**Collaboration and Integration:** We collaborate with all focus areas within the organization. We work closely with other teams to integrate risk management practices into every phase of our app's lifecycle.  

**Proactive Risk Management:** We take a proactive approach to risk management. We actively identify, assess, manage, and mitigate risks. We anticipate and address potential issues before they escalate.  

**User-Centric Focus:** We center safeguarding the interests of Palestinian users and our Pals. We prioritize user well-being and safety in all its actions and decisions.  

**Transparency and Accountability:** We are commited to transparency and accountability. 

## Reporting
Report a risk: Risks can and should be reported by any staff member here: [Risk Identification Reporting](https://github.com/orgs/PalCollective/projects/4)

person or team is responsible for that step, please write their name in
that line. If a step has been completed, please either copy/paste or
link to the relevant information.

Your voice: Please add comments or directly edit as needed.

Urgent need: Please add your thoughts to the ethical matrix.

== Process Overview

image:assets/process.png[assets/process,width=320,height=630]



== Core Values and Principles

Core values: foundation upon which the collective is built. These will
guide the principles, the rules and truths that will provide the
guardrails for the app. Principles provide a framework for ethical
conduct and decision-making.

=== Pyramid of Values

This has been adopted from the GitLab handbook
(https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/[[.underline]#https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#]).

=== Safety and Efficiency/Effectiveness: Knobs/Levers

There is a tension between safety and efficiency/effectiveness. We seek
to find the right balance for our application.

The *ethical matrix* helps to identify potential harms. The matrix
identifies *stakeholders* that interact with or are affected by the app,
and *ethical values* that may be infringed upon due to their use of, or
the existence of, the app. Each cell is filled with *potential harms* to
the stakeholder based on the values that we have prioritized.
Stakeholders and values may be added as more voices are involved in the
discussion and as the app continues to develop. It is acceptable for
some cells to be left blank.

*Potential harms* listed are those that would occur because of
interaction with the app, not including those that are happening at
baseline. For example, Palestinians are of course already experiencing
many negative mental and physical effects due to being victims of war.
It is not listed here because that is not a potential harm of engaging
with the app.

Potential harms will be of *differing priority*. Some may need many
resources and frequent re-assessment, others may be completely
deprioritized at certain points of the lifecycle. For example, “Aid is
not distributed in a just/equitable way (based on gender, age, etc)” may
not be an urgent priority. However, looking further ahead, this may be
more important as fair access to aid could influence the social makeup
as the Palestinian society begins to rebuild.

This is a *starting point for further engagement*. For example, verbal
abuse in the chat may be identified as a realistic harm, and a chatbot
explored to mitigate this harm. This intervention could be further
assessed with an AI-focused assessment (does the chatbot perform equally
well for different languages, does it show bias when filtering comments,
and so on).

This matrix also helps *identify the need for subject matter experts*,
such as those involved in payment security.

*A note about governments (official or unofficial) as a stakeholder. Our
app is not made for them, and we arguably don’t prioritize their needs.
However, the government will prioritize their own need, so this exercise
can help us think about some ways in which the government might feel
infringed upon and move to block the app.

=== Prioritized Harms

*Priority Levels*

*P0 (Critical)*: Issues categorized as P0 are critical and require
immediate attention. They pose significant risks to the app's
functionality, security, or user experience, potentially leading to
severe consequences if not addressed promptly. These issues demand
immediate mitigation efforts and may require dedicated resources to
resolve.

*P1 (High)*: Issues categorized as P1 are high priority and should be
addressed urgently. While they may not be as severe as P0 issues, they
still have the potential to cause significant harm or disruption to the
app or its users. Prompt action is necessary to mitigate these risks and
prevent any negative impacts on the app's performance or security.

*P2 (Medium)*: Issues categorized as P2 have a moderate level of
priority. They may not require immediate attention but should be
addressed in a timely manner to prevent them from escalating into more
severe problems. These issues may have a moderate impact on the app or
its users if left unresolved and should be prioritized accordingly.

*P3 (Low)*: Issues categorized as P3 have a low priority and may not
require immediate action. While they should still be addressed, they
have minimal impact on the app's functionality, security, or user
experience. These issues can be handled during regular maintenance
cycles or as resources permit, without causing significant disruptions
to the app's operations.

== Risk Management Framework 

Working on building this out.

image:media/image4.png[media/image4,width=584,height=481]

=== Summary of Risk Management Framework (RMF):

* *Risk identification*: This involves identifying potential risks that
could impact the objectives, including internal and external factors.
This is based off of the ethical matrix, but will go into greater
detail.
* *Risk assessment*: Risks are evaluated in terms of their likelihood of
occurrence and potential impact on the objectives. This assessment helps
prioritize risks based on their significance.
* *Risk response*: After assessing risks, develop strategies to respond
to them. Responses may include avoiding, mitigating, transferring, or
accepting risks, depending on the risk tolerance.
* *Risk monitoring and control*: Once risks have been identified,
assessed, and responded to, ongoing monitoring and control processes are
implemented to track changes in risk exposure and ensure that risk
responses remain effective.
* *Governance and accountability*: Governance structures and processes
to ensure accountability for managing risks effectively throughout the
collective
* *Documentation and reporting*: Clear documentation of the risk
management process and outcomes, as well as regular reporting, are
important to ensure transparency and accountability
