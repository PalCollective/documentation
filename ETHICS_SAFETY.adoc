# Introduction - Ethics and Safety

The role of the ethics and safety team is to prioritize the well-being and safety of Palestinians and Pals, while also ensuring that our actions are in alignment with our ethical principles.    

We are committed to:   
**Continuous Improvement:** As our collective grows, we continuously refine and update our processes and approaches to better safeguard the interests of the app and its users.  

**Collaboration and Integration:** We collaborate with all focus areas within the organization. We work closely with other teams to integrate risk management practices into every phase of our app's lifecycle.  

**Proactive Risk Management:** We take a proactive approach to risk management. We actively identify, assess, manage, and mitigate risks. We anticipate and address potential issues before they escalate.  

**User-Centric Focus:** We center safeguarding the interests of Palestinian users and our Pals. We prioritize user well-being and safety in all its actions and decisions.  

**Transparency and Accountability:** We are commited to transparency and accountability.

== Pre-Core Values Considerations

Clarity in these areas will help develop the core values.

=== The Lack of a Shared Understanding Around Supporting a People Targeted by Genocide

In original onboarding documents, it wasn’t mentioned that the Israeli
government is committing genocide, backed by US dollars, and US
political support. That may seem political and unnecessary when the
stated goal is just to “help people”, but if we aren’t naming the reason
_why_ we are anxious and trying to move rapidly to help Gazans in the
first place, we will miss some very critical points in our attempts to
deliver aid.

Focusing on helping the ‘marginalized’ or ‘oppressed’ without
acknowledging and challenging the systems, and actors who are doing the
marginalization or oppression actually maintains and supports harm to
keep happening towards the very people we wish to help.

How does this specifically affect this project? I believe it’s
imperative that we:

* Have a shared understanding that we are aiming to support people being
targeted for a genocide, and thus acknowledge that _there are bad actors
at play that we have to be aware of_ and obfuscate.
* Acknowledge that _the seeking of aid & support_ in of itself has been
used in multiple ways to attack Gazans, and therefore we *_have to_*
ensure that the tool we develop in trying to support them can not be
used to harm them.
* We acknowledge that the very nature of trying to break barriers in
providing aid, may be counter to the goals of the current US government,
and there may be attempts to try to stop this project from law
enforcement, etc. (there is precedence for this)
* Understand that there _will_ be ‘bad actors’ that _will_ attempt to
infiltrate this collective, and/or people with the intention to directly
troll, taunt, or harass the people of Gaza who may want to sign up as
volunteers.
* We acknowledge that although our best intentions are good, our efforts
could unintentionally cause more harm, if we jump into a situation
without adequate knowledge.
* Because of these stated things, proper training, vetting of
volunteers, _and privacy protocols_ is essential to anyone who would:
** Be able to alter/share information from the webpage
** Have access to any identifiable information from Gazan’s asking for
help
** Be speaking to or supporting Gazans directly

=== The Lack of a Shared Understanding of What Type of Aid YPC is Best Suited to Deliver

There are a lot of potential harms that could be created by connected
masses of untrained, uninformed volunteers to folks experiencing a
direct genocide, _is the possibility that the aid that is delivered is
in itself, harmful and unhelpful._ A few questions we need to sit with:

[arabic]
. What biases or assumptions might we have internalized about the
inherent value “aid givers”, or volunteers could provide?
. Do we have an informed, clear understanding of what requests for aid
are coming from _[.mark]#folks in Palestine, by Palestinians?#_
. Can we bring on board people with experience in giving aid to people
experiencing war, in order to train volunteers?

What volunteers we prioritize to onboard (professions, skill sets, etc)
and what training those volunteers need should be determined by the
direct vocalized needs of folks in Gaza.

*Potential Harms as YPC as a Peer to Peer Connector*

If we using YPC to link Palestinians directly to a mass of volunteers
who want to connect, we could be connecting folks in the midsts of one
of the most intense crises’ ever to people who have no background in:

* Crisis intervention
* Trauma-informed care
* Decolonized mental health practices
* Palestinian language and culture
* Anti-oppressive practices

Although there is value in connecting folks across culture, building
connections, relationships, and connecting humans to humans. The harms
can be life-threatening and can include:

* Any harms that would ordinarily be considered malpractice (without any
protections of licensing bodies)
* Exposing those seeking help to racism, religious proselytizing,
classism, and more from folks who are “well-intentioned”
* Violations of privacy, of intentionally or unintentionally exposing
details of private conversations that would put Gazans at psychological,
physical or emotional risk
* Exploitation (of personal shared stories) and/or abuse within the chat

is an editable list of possible uses of YPC for delivering aid#]

=== Nuances Between “Help” and “Mutual Aid”

T[.mark]##he word "help" in itself needs to be cleared up. It's vague,
focuses more on the intentions of the "giver" instead of the impact of
the actions, further perpetuates 'top down charity' ideas, and is
distinctly different from mutual aid. As much as possible, let's clarify
what we are aiming to do, provide, etc.##

[.mark]#In an article entitled
https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/the-co-option-of-mutual-aid[[.underline]#Co-opting
Mutual Aid#] author
https://briarpatchmagazine.com/contributors/view/de-loggans-regan[Regan
de Loggans] made two different points this collective may consider:#

* [.mark]#Mutual aid defies the hierarchies and white saviorism inherent
to charity, instead asking us to share our skills and resources in order
to decentralize community care, and help one another break free from
capitalism and colonial authority.#
* [.mark]#We are being quite literal when we say that mutual aid, when
practiced by people of color, has led to community members being
targeted, incarcerated, and murdered by the government.#

[.mark]#Specifically to the last point, a mutual aid project that
supports folks being targeted in genocide may lead to several
implications for the organizers and volunteers:#

* [.mark]#Being listed or identified as supporting and abetting “enemies
of the state”#
* [.mark]#Secondary and/or vicarious trauma#

=== Next Steps: 

==== Declaration of genocide?

==== Scope of aid

==== Defining aid vs help

== Core Values and Principles

Core values: foundation upon which the collective is built. These will
guide the principles, the rules and truths that will provide the
guardrails for the app. Principles provide a framework for ethical
conduct and decision-making.

=== Pyramid of Values

This has been adopted from the GitLab handbook
(https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/[[.underline]#https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#]).

=== Safety and Efficiency/Effectiveness: Knobs/Levers

There is a tension between safety and efficiency/effectiveness. We seek
to find the right balance for our application.

The *ethical matrix* helps to identify potential harms. The matrix
identifies *stakeholders* that interact with or are affected by the app,
and *ethical values* that may be infringed upon due to their use of, or
the existence of, the app. Each cell is filled with *potential harms* to
the stakeholder based on the values that we have prioritized.
Stakeholders and values may be added as more voices are involved in the
discussion and as the app continues to develop. It is acceptable for
some cells to be left blank.

*Potential harms* listed are those that would occur because of
interaction with the app, not including those that are happening at
baseline. For example, Palestinians are of course already experiencing
many negative mental and physical effects due to being victims of war.
It is not listed here because that is not a potential harm of engaging
with the app.

Potential harms will be of *differing priority*. Some may need many
resources and frequent re-assessment, others may be completely
deprioritized at certain points of the lifecycle. For example, “Aid is
not distributed in a just/equitable way (based on gender, age, etc)” may
not be an urgent priority. However, looking further ahead, this may be
more important as fair access to aid could influence the social makeup
as the Palestinian society begins to rebuild.

This is a *starting point for further engagement*. For example, verbal
abuse in the chat may be identified as a realistic harm, and a chatbot
explored to mitigate this harm. This intervention could be further
assessed with an AI-focused assessment (does the chatbot perform equally
well for different languages, does it show bias when filtering comments,
and so on).

This matrix also helps *identify the need for subject matter experts*,
such as those involved in payment security.

*A note about governments (official or unofficial) as a stakeholder. Our
app is not made for them, and we arguably don’t prioritize their needs.
However, the government will prioritize their own need, so this exercise
can help us think about some ways in which the government might feel
infringed upon and move to block the app.

=== Prioritized Harms

*Priority Levels*

*P0 (Critical)*: Issues categorized as P0 are critical and require
immediate attention. They pose significant risks to the app's
functionality, security, or user experience, potentially leading to
severe consequences if not addressed promptly. These issues demand
immediate mitigation efforts and may require dedicated resources to
resolve.

*P1 (High)*: Issues categorized as P1 are high priority and should be
addressed urgently. While they may not be as severe as P0 issues, they
still have the potential to cause significant harm or disruption to the
app or its users. Prompt action is necessary to mitigate these risks and
prevent any negative impacts on the app's performance or security.

*P2 (Medium)*: Issues categorized as P2 have a moderate level of
priority. They may not require immediate attention but should be
addressed in a timely manner to prevent them from escalating into more
severe problems. These issues may have a moderate impact on the app or
its users if left unresolved and should be prioritized accordingly.

*P3 (Low)*: Issues categorized as P3 have a low priority and may not
require immediate action. While they should still be addressed, they
have minimal impact on the app's functionality, security, or user
experience. These issues can be handled during regular maintenance
cycles or as resources permit, without causing significant disruptions
to the app's operations.

== Risk Management Framework 

Working on building this out.

image:media/image4.png[media/image4,width=584,height=481]

=== Summary of Risk Management Framework (RMF):

* *Risk identification*: This involves identifying potential risks that
could impact the objectives, including internal and external factors.
This is based off of the ethical matrix, but will go into greater
detail.
* *Risk assessment*: Risks are evaluated in terms of their likelihood of
occurrence and potential impact on the objectives. This assessment helps
prioritize risks based on their significance.
* *Risk response*: After assessing risks, develop strategies to respond
to them. Responses may include avoiding, mitigating, transferring, or
accepting risks, depending on the risk tolerance.
* *Risk monitoring and control*: Once risks have been identified,
assessed, and responded to, ongoing monitoring and control processes are
implemented to track changes in risk exposure and ensure that risk
responses remain effective.
* *Governance and accountability*: Governance structures and processes
to ensure accountability for managing risks effectively throughout the
collective
* *Documentation and reporting*: Clear documentation of the risk
management process and outcomes, as well as regular reporting, are
important to ensure transparency and accountability
