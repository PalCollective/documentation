## Resolving Ethical Conflicts
At any time, you can request that someone from Ethics and Safety joins your team to discuss an ethical conflict.

https://github.com/PalCollective/documentation/blob/main/ES_Ethical_Matrix.md[Ethical Matrix] The *ethical matrix* is a participatory tool that can frame ethical conflicts for deliberation by a dedicated team. You can use the template, or request training or participation from someone on Ethics and Safety.
