# Introduction - Ethics and Safety

## The role of the ethics and safety team is to prioritize the well-being and safety of Palestinians and Pals, while also ensuring that our actions are in alignment with the core values and principles of PalCollective.    



### We are committed to:   
**Continuous Improvement:** As our collective grows, we continuously refine and update our processes and approaches to better safeguard the interests of the app and its users.  

**Collaboration and Integration:** We collaborate with all focus areas within the organization. We work closely with other teams to integrate risk management practices into every phase of our app's lifecycle.  

**Proactive Risk Management:** We take a proactive approach to risk management. We actively identify, assess, manage, and mitigate risks. We anticipate and address potential issues before they escalate.  

**User-Centric Focus:** We center safeguarding the interests of Palestinian users and our Pals. We prioritize user well-being and safety in all its actions and decisions.  

**Transparency and Accountability:** We are commited to transparency and accountability.

## Resolving Ethical Conflicts
**Request collaboration**
At any time, you can request that someone from Ethics and Safety joins your team to discuss an ethical conflict.

**Ethical Matrix**
The ethical matrix is a participatory tool that can frame ethical conflicts for deliberation by a dedicated team. You can use the template, or request training or participation from someone on Ethics and Safety. https://github.com/PalCollective/documentation/blob/main/ES_Ethical_Matrix.adoc[More about the ethical matrix]
