# Palship Method

## Principles to be followed by pals

1. No action, no rally
1. No opinion from the ground, no action
1. Not met by another Gazan, unvetted
1. Vet Gazans by meeting smaller needs first, before trying to meet larger needs
1. Prioritise: favor meeting shorter-term life-sustaining needs inside of Gaza

### Examples

1. It is a mistake to rally doctors of a certain speciality over a case in Gaza when it is unclear how they can help while being outside the country, it is a good idea on the other hand to rally nutritionists after deciding that a diet plan is needed, and ensuring that we have the means of buying the supplies and delivering them within Gaza.
1. It is a mistake to start purchasing art supplies and thinking of ways to get them into Gaza when no one in Gaza has been told of this initiative. The reason being that even though the motive is good, the state of mind this effort stems from is out of sync with that of the Gazans. Before using resources of the collective, it is imperative to have a few Gazans or facing pals confirm the idea is suitable and make sense.
1. It is a mistake to create a campaign for someone you never met and was not met by anyone you are in touch with, as this person can be outside of Gaza or may not be amongst the neediest.
1. It is a mistake to try to cater to all the needs of one family through a camaign, because this aggregates their short term, mid term and long term needs together, making it hard to proritise for the donors and creates a hierarchy of privilage amongst the Gazans, which further degrades their unity and solidarity.

## Support that pals need

1. Personal donation tracking and financial advisory, a second opinion on how much to donate and whether someone is donating while emotionally affected
1. Boundaries check, time boundaries are major example
1. Trigger check, the moment we become rude to war victims, we know we are not taking care of ourselves

A concept of a pal assigned therapist with regular checks might not be a bad idea. A team can be provided.

## Onboarding order

1. Free non-collective pals: people already doing palship by talking to families in Gaza
1. Spontaneous pals: people whose participating in cases introduced them into palship
1. Willing pals: those who want to become pals

### Explanation

People who are already doing palship work alone are most likely to be comitting some of the mistakes we did and must be supported before anyone else. After that, we can start looking after the ones who got in contact with Gazans because of their involvement with us.
