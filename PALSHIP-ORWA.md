# Palship Method

## Principles

1. No action, no rally
1. No opinion from the ground, no action
1. Not met by another Gazan, unvetted
1. Vet Gazans by meeting smaller needs first, before trying to meet larger needs
1. Prioritise: favor meeting shorter-term life-sustaining needs inside of Gaza

## Onboarding order

1. Free non-collective pals: people already doing palship by talking to families in Gaza
1. Spontaneous pals: people whose participating in cases introduced them into palship
1. Willing pals: those who want to become pals
