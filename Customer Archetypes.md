## The Gazan Journey:
**The Problem:** They are requesting help but not able to find the right people to have solutions. 

**Solution:**  We start to humanize them, and VET them to hear that they are actually doing something. 

Start to build trust, we are a safe place, we are helping you.
Start the verification process sending a message of something like this:

*I will set up a WhatsApp to respond and reach out to them, it needs to be very informal in terms of a technical solution, but should be informed for the Pals of what exactly they are saying.*

We are reaching out on behalf of Your Pal Collective. We are a team of people that see the struggle going on in Gaza and can not stay silent or take no action. We dream of connecting you with solutions and cutting down bureaucracy with the power of humanity on our side. We would welcome an opportunity to learn more about you.


Start into the storytelling process.
- Who/What/When/Where/Why
- Current Struggles
- Why go through this?
- Do you know anyone else we could reach out to and help?
- Give them the resources from Olive Branch and direct them to our platform to sign up for phase 2. At least give them the link in Phase 1 of what the public page looks like.


##The Pal Journey:
- Reach out to every one of the listed GoFundMe campaigns from Your Pal Databases and Olive Branch Collective. 
- Start to figure out who they are, learn their story, share your personal testament. 
- Ask similar questions to value propositions for agile development.
- What value do you wish to bring? WHat are you looking for help in?
- We ask the new Gazans on the platform to fill out surveys but they wouldn’t be surveys, they would be text messages back and forth with Pals. 
- The first phase of Pals is about connecting to the Gazan and building trust. 

**The role of a Pal:**
1. Build trust with the Gazan
1. Verify that the Gazan is as best as they can tell in Gaza and actually supporting someone there
1. Collect data for tech team


##The Volunteer/Gen Public:
**Message:**Start to see the power of stories and the humanity that is in Gaza. They see ‘stories’ or blurbs similar to a social media page and perhaps thats all we start with. Scrapping the data into one place. Start to build out the website that shows those requests as well, but this can start with just the stories. 
You know the struggle that is going on, but do you know anyone there? WOuld you like to? Do you wish you could help but don’t know where to start? That is what we are building. Join the waitlist to join our platform. We can connect you directly to help to be activated instead of just scrolling mindlessly on social media. We also understand that sometimes this is too heavy so we will share both success stories and struggles to where we are going. There will be customized requests that you will be able to receive in the future of being able to provide aid 1:1. We believe in the power of community and essentially crowd sourcing solidarity and aid. We can’t sit back, we are the definition of grassroots. 

The **customer archetype** of the volunteer/new breed of activist:
- Part time activist, bleeding heart, has a full life otherwise. Wants to help, feels led to help, but doesn’t know how. 
- They are ‘good’ people who see the humanity in others and have just HOPE that this could do something, and why not try?

**The Problem:** Lack of information around being able to contribute meaningfully in the crisis that is happening in Gaza. May not want their reputation to be aligned with supporting the cause, doesn’t want to receive push back for showing up. 

Another thing as a core value we have brought in is a working theory that a new form of activist has yet to surface: the part-time activist. When we think about activism, we think about the people marching on the streets. What about the stay-at-home mom or the person with the full-time job that would lose their job if they dared show up in a place like that? Everyone is busy. If we could take part of that free time, coupled with a semblance of a bleeding heart for Palestine, we can really do something big. 

We are working under the assumption that those in Palestine need help. People are trying to deliver aid, it’s being stolen. People are donating funds, it’s being embezzled. So how can we build a way for people who want to help actually have a way to connect with people? However, how can we do it in such a way that we are not causing harm to those already in harms way out of ignorance or a technology solution being the way in which they are found.
