## The Gazan Journey:

The problem: They are requesting help but not able to find the right people to have solutions. 
Solution: We start to humanize them, and VET them to hear that they are actually doing something. 
Start to build trust, we are a safe place, we are helping you.
Start the verification process sending a message of something like this:

I will set up a WhatsApp to respond and reach out to them, it needs to be very informal in terms of a technical solution, but should be informed for the Pals of what exactly they are saying.

We are reaching out on behalf of Your Pal Collective. We are a team of people that see the struggle going on in Gaza and can not stay silent or take no action. We dream of connecting you with solutions and cutting down bureaucracy with the power of humanity on our side. We would welcome an opportunity to learn more about you.
