# Welcome to Your Pal Collective.

## Current Moment

As of this stage in the venture, there are many moving pieces and parts and trying to understand where people fit and HOW we can divide up the work is of the utmost importance. We’ve shifted geers a few times, but in all what we are building is an (anonymous) peer-to-peer matching/communication platform for those in Gaza to those on the outside. That idea alone has come with its share of conflicts and real issues to getting those rolled out and implemented.

## Parts of the Team

Where we are right now, we are building out a team of real people. We are building and working with people who are passionate about implementing real change and want to use their giftings and talents for good. This is a volunteer based project and there are many ways to help. For me, I start off by placing people into 1-3 roles.

1. **Drivers** - These are people who are wanting to participate in meaningful conversations, strategy, executive level type conversations, visionaries, problem solvers.10+ hours/week
1. **Not right now** - Want to help, but may not have bandwidth, experience, or comfortability with working on the project right now. 
1. **Taskers** - Limited bandwidth in terms of what you can work on with all that you have on your plate, but want to help do meaningful work. 5-10 hours/week

We want to work with people who want to work on the project in ways that they desire and there is no better role or need as we need a combination of both Taskers & Drivers for this to work the way it’s intended. 

In terms of next steps, there are two teams working in tandem towards each other and going towards one mission. 
1. Human/People Team
1. Tech Team
