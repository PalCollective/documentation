# Risk Identification and Incident Reporting for Pals

## Who is involved in risk identification and incident reporting?
You are a critical identifier of any risks and incidents, no matter how small. We need our Pals who are using the apps and communicating with Gazans to report anything that might worry you or that you can envision becoming a problem.

## What are risks? What are incidents?
A risk is anything that could jeopardize the safety and well-being of anyone who uses the app, as well as anything that could lead to reduced or ineffective aid, or reduced efficiency of administering aid or connecting aid. As incident is an adverse event of any type, think of it as a "risk come true".

We don't want you to worry about the difference between risks and incidents. Bottom line, if something concerns you, report it. 

Some examples of risks and incidents are a security vulnerability in the app, phishing behavior in-app, or observation that the app disconnects under certain circumstances. 

## How do I report a risk or incident?
All risks and incidents can be reported using THIS FORM. 
If you feel that the risk or incident is urgent, please also immediately send a message to PERSON HERE.
If you feel that someone is in immediate danger, contact METHOD HERE. 

## What is the process after I report a risk or incident? 
We expect to review a report within 24 hours. If needed, we will contact you for more information. 
Both risks and incidents will be triaged by staff, and added to our workflow based on priority. They will then be assessed by a team of staff members, and a management or mitigation plan put in place. 

## Will I be penalized for reporting?
Never. Integrity is one of our core values. We honor and appreciate your viewpoints and your experiences. You will not experience any penalty or other negative outcome for reporting.
